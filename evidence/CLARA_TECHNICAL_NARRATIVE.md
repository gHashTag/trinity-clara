# CLARA TA1/TA2 Technical Narrative

**Submission:** DARPA CLARA (Common Learning Repository for AI)
**Submitter:** Trinity S³AI Project
**Repository:** https://github.com/gHashTag/t27
**Date:** April 8, 2026
**Ring:** 088

## Executive Summary

Trinity S³AI proposes a novel approach to AI reasoning by integrating ternary logic (Kleene K3) with Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA) and formal argumentation systems. Our submission addresses CLARA TA1 (Argumentation & Reasoning) and TA2 (Composition Library) requirements through:

1. **Bounded Reasoning**: Proof traces strictly limited to ≤10 steps, ensuring computational tractability
2. **Ternary Foundation**: Balanced ternary (−1, 0, +1) as native representation for uncertainty
3. **Composition Patterns**: Four ML+AR hybrid patterns for safe, explainable AI systems

---

## 1. Ternary Logic Foundation (TA1)

### 1.1 Kleene K3 Semantics

We implement Kleene's three-valued logic as the foundational reasoning substrate:

```
K_FALSE   = −1 (TRIT_NEG)
K_UNKNOWN =  0  (TRIT_ZERO)
K_TRUE    = +1 (TRIT_POS)
```

This maps naturally to VSA hypervector components and provides native representation of:
- **Uncertainty**: `K_UNKNOWN` for incomplete information
- **Bivalence**: `K_FALSE/K_TRUE` for definite conclusions
- **Gradation**: Smooth interpolation between values

### 1.2 Formal Operations

All logical operations implement standard K3 truth tables:

| AND       | K_FALSE | K_UNKNOWN | K_TRUE |
|-----------|---------|-----------|--------|
| K_FALSE   | K_FALSE | K_FALSE   | K_FALSE |
| K_UNKNOWN | K_FALSE | K_UNKNOWN | K_UNKNOWN |
| K_TRUE    | K_FALSE | K_UNKNOWN | K_TRUE  |

Complexity: O(1) per operation, enabling fast inference at scale.

## 2. Bounded Proof Traces (TA1)

### 2.1 Step Limit Enforcement

Proof traces are strictly bounded to 10 steps:

```
const MAX_STEPS: usize = 10;

struct ProofTrace {
    steps: [MAX_STEPS]DerivationStep;
    step_count: usize;
}
```

The `verify_trace()` function enforces this invariant:
- Rejects any trace exceeding 10 derivation steps
- Validates logical consistency at each step
- Returns explicit error on violation

### 2.2 Trace Structure

Each derivation step contains:
- **Premise set**: Input facts for this step
- **Applied rule**: Rule identifier
- **Conclusion**: Derived fact
- **Justification**: Reference to rule definition

This structure enables:
- Post-hoc explanation generation
- Step-by-step XAI output
- Trace replay for verification

---

## 3. Forward-Chaining Datalog (TA1)

### 3.1 Horn Clause Engine

Our Datalog engine implements forward chaining with O(n) complexity:

```
struct HornClause {
    head: Atom;
    body: []Atom;
}

fn derive(facts: []Atom, rules: []HornClause) -> []Atom {
    // Linear-time forward chaining
}
```

Key features:
- **Fact/Rule Separation**: Clear distinction in data model
- **No Negation**: Pure Horn clauses for monotonic inference
- **Iterative Closure**: Fixed-point computation

### 3.2 Bounded Rationality

The `RestraintParams` module implements bounded rationality:

```
struct RestraintParams {
    max_steps: usize = 10;
    min_quality: f64 = 0.7;
    time_budget_ms: u64 = 1000;
}
```

The `should_continue()` decision function returns `K_FALSE` when:
- Step count exceeds `max_steps`
- Computed quality falls below threshold
- Time budget exhausted

---

## 4. Explainability (TA1)

### 4.1 Bounded Explanations

XAI module generates explanations with same ≤10 step constraint:

```
fn generate_explanation(trace: ProofTrace, format: XAIFormat) → Explanation {
    // Generate natural language, Fitch-style, or compact format
    // Subject to MAX_STEPS constraint
}
```

Output formats:
- **Natural Language**: Human-readable prose
- **Fitch-Style**: Formal proof notation
- **Compact**: Condensed step-by-step summary

### 4.2 Quality Metrics

Explanation quality measured via:
- **Coherence**: Logical flow validation
- **Completeness**: All premises accounted for
- **Brevity**: Conciseness within step limits

---

## 5. ASP with NAF (TA1)

### 5.1 Answer Set Programming

Our ASP solver extends Datalog with Negation as Failure:

```
struct AspRule extends HornClause {
    naf_body: []Atom;  // Negation as failure atoms
}

fn compute_stable_model(rules: []AspRule) -> StableModel {
    // Compute consistent assignment satisfying NAF
}
```

NAF semantics:
- Negation assumes false by default
- Supports non-monotonic reasoning
- Computes stable models (answer sets)

---

## 6. VSA Operations (TA2)

### 6.1 Hypervector Bind/Unbind

VSA operations work on 1024-dimensional hypervectors:

```
const VSA_DIM: usize = 1024;

fn bind(role: Hypervector, value: Hypervector) → Hypervector {
    // XOR-like associative binding
    return role ⊕ value;
}

fn unbind(hypervector: Hypervector, role: Hypervector) → Hypervector {
    // Inverse of bind
    return hypervector ⊕ role;
}
```

Properties:
- **Associative**: `(a ⊕ b) ⊕ c = a ⊕ (b ⊕ c)`
- **Invertible**: `unbind(bind(r, v), r) = v`
- **Disentangle**: Roles allow selective unbinding

### 6.2 Bundle Operations

Bundle represents set superposition:

```
fn bundle2(a: Hypervector, b: Hypervector) → Hypervector {
    return a + b;  // Element-wise addition
}
```

Used for:
- Set representation (multiple values)
- Pattern matching (feature bundles)
- Memory retrieval (similarity search)

### 6.3 Similarity Metrics

Three similarity metrics supported:

| Metric       | Formula                     | Use Case               |
|--------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Cosine       | cos(θ) = (a·b)/(|a||b|) | Semantic similarity     |
| Hamming      | |a − b|₁                 | Set operations         |
| Dot Product  | a·b                        | Correlation detection  |

## 7. ML+AR Composition Patterns (TA1/TA2)

### 7.1 CNN + Rules

Neural feature extraction → Rule pattern matching → Deduction

```
struct CNNRulesPipeline {
    cnn: CNNComponent;
    rules: RuleEngine;
    xai: ExplainabilityModule;
}
```

Flow:
1. CNN extracts features from input
2. Rule engine matches feature patterns
3. AR module performs deduction
4. XAI generates ≤10 step explanation

### 7.2 MLP + Bayesian

Neural forward pass → Bayesian inference → Probabilistic reasoning

```
struct MLPBayesianPipeline {
    mlp: MLPComponent;
    bayesian: BayesianInference;
    restraint: RestraintParams;
}
```

### 7.3 Transformer + XAI

Self-attention → Explanation generation → Step limit enforcement

### 7.4 RL + Guardrails

Policy network → AR constraint evaluation → Safe action selection
