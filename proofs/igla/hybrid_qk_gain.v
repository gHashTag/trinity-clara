   IGLA-INV-013: Hybrid attention QK-gain anchored at phi^2
   File: hybrid_qk_gain.v

   Mission context (from trios#143 Gate-2 pre-registration):
     For the ngram + 1-layer causal self-attention hybrid that is
     the planned Gate-2 architecture, the trainer must clamp the
     softmax gain on the QK^T product to one of the phi-anchored
     values {phi^2, phi^3} = {2.618..., 4.236...}.  Any other gain
     unanchors the head from the Trinity identity and forfeits
     the L-R14 traceability that the race rules require.

     Combined with the lr-band INV-1, this fixes the only two
     architectural degrees of freedom Gate-2 is permitted to vary.

   Hypothesis (Popper-falsifiable, mirrors the pre-reg comment):
     H_INV13:
       forall trainer cfg,  if cfg is admitted by the runtime guard
       then  qk_gain(cfg) in {phi^2, phi^3}
        AND  lr(cfg) in [phi_alpha / phi^4, phi_alpha].

   Falsifier (refutation observable):
     H_INV13 is FALSE iff ANY of the four counter_* cases below is
     accepted by the runtime guard.  In Coq we record the structural
     shape of each counter as a `Definition`; the binding refutation
     is the corresponding `falsify_*` Rust test in
     trios:crates/trios-igla-race/src/bin/qk_gain_check.rs.

   Anchor:  Trinity Identity   phi^2 + phi^-2 = 3

   R5 honesty: every theorem in this file is honestly `Admitted`.
   The binding contract is the Rust guard, mirrored test-for-test
   in `falsify_*` Rust tests.  No `Qed.` unless the body has been
   discharged in real Rocq -- this file ships under R5.

   FALSIFICATION SHAPES (R8) -- documented but Admitted.

   Each `counter_*` records the shape of an input the runtime gate
   must REJECT.  The binding refutation is the matching `falsify_*`
   Rust test in qk_gain_check.rs.  All four are Admitted in this
   file; flipping any to Qed without real Rocq elaboration of the
   reals arithmetic violates R5.

(* Counter 1: lr exactly 0.01 -- the pre-attention-only attempt that
   plateaued at BPB ~ 4.74 (cf. pre-reg §1).  Above the lr-ceiling. *)
Theorem counter_lr_above_band :
  ~ lr_admissible 0.01.
Proof. Admitted.

(* Counter 2: lr = 0.0001 -- one decade below the band's lower edge. *)
Theorem counter_lr_below_band :
  ~ lr_admissible 0.0001.
Proof. Admitted.

(* Counter 3: gain = 1.0 -- vanilla softmax attention (no temperature),
   the textbook setting.  Forbidden because un-anchored. *)
Theorem counter_gain_unit :
  ~ qk_gain_admissible 1.
Proof. Admitted.

(* Counter 4: gain = sqrt(d_model) = sqrt(64) = 8 -- the conventional
   attention scaling.  Forbidden by the phi-anchored gain rule. *)
Theorem counter_gain_sqrt_d_model :
  ~ qk_gain_admissible 8.
Proof. Admitted.

(* ================================================================
   POSITIVE SHAPES -- the two admissible gains are accepted.
   These ARE definitionally trivial (Coq reduces `or`-introduction
   on a `Definition`-equal value), so they ship as `Qed.`.

Lemma admit_phi_sq : qk_gain_admissible (phi ^ 2).

   STRUCTURAL WELL-TYPEDNESS  (Admitted under R5).

   The runtime guard `qk_gain_check.rs::admit_cfg` is the binding
   contract.  This theorem records what we *would* have to prove
   if we wanted to lift the runtime check into Coq.

  forall c : Cfg,
    cfg_admissible c
    -> qk_gain_admissible (cfg_gain c) /\ lr_admissible (cfg_lr c).
Proof. Admitted.
